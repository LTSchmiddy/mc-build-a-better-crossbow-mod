# Build a Better Crossbow Mod

Were you excited about the addition of the crossbow in Minecraft's Village and Pillage Update, only to be disappointed crappy they turned out to be for general use? Do you live in hope that, one day, they could actually be a viable alternative to the bow?

Well friends, worry no more! Introducing the "Build a Better Crossbow" mod for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.18+. By default, this overhauls the crossbow's mechanics to complement the bow without altering the bow's vanilla behaviour. However, this is a highly configurable, and can be adjusted to suit your individual preferences. The mod works completely server-side, however clients can install it for better utility.

I've been using this mod on my private server for a year or two now, and I've decided it's time to publish it. Thanks to that time play-testing, we've adjusted the defaults to be as balanced as possible, and I'm fairly confident in this mod's stability.

## What does the overhaul change?

Build a Better Crossbow (BBC) is balanced around the idea of making the crossbow a more powerful weapon than the bow, but it's also a more expensive weapon to use.

The default configuration works as follows:

* The base damage of the crossbow has been increased slightly. Unenchanted, it now does roughly the damage of a Power III bow. This is to make up for the crossbow's more expensive crafting recipe and longer chargeup time.

* The Punch and Flame enchantments can now be applied to the crossbow using an anvil.

* The Quickcharge enchantment now goes up to level 5, which is effectively instant loading (This is actually behavior from vanilla Minecraft, if you aquire a Quickcharge V crossbow using commands. BBC simply raises the maximum enchantment level to 5).

* The Multi-shot enchantment now goes up to level 4, same as Piercing. Each level of the Multi-shot enchantment adds 2 additional arrows to the volley. The angle of spread is unchanged.
